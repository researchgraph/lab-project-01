  * Width - width in pixel
  * Height - height in pixel
  * NodeRadius - Radius of the node before hover 
  * NodeRadiusDuration - Transition duration from small to large node size on hover
  * GraphTransition - Transition duartion of the entire graph
  * NodeStrokeWidth - Width of the Border
  * NodeStrokeOpacity - Opacity of the border
  * Strength - Stength of attraction or repulsion between nodes
  * LinkStrokeOpacity - Opacity of the links
  * LinkStrokeWidth - Width of the links
